          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <p> This research started with this question: what is the way to go in the direction of the best design decision without falling into the swamp of dangers of categorical thinking? We all categorize everything, simplify and judge it based on categorization and this is instinctively happens in surviving. Therefore, categorical thinking comes naturally to us, but it easily leads to judgment wrapped by prejudice. In categorical thinking, we usually judge an individual's identity by stereotyping it as a group identity. This is the most dangerous part of categorical thinking. This can naturally appear in the design discipline process as well. During the project ‘curtain’ I did in my first year I had this question, ‘why people in the Netherlands don’t cover their curtain?’ While taking pictures and conducting field research, I realized that the curtain's appearance had different aspects depending on individual tastes regardless of the character of a particular ethnic group.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent:3em;" > We easily delude ourselves we know the dangers of categorical thinking. But, as we have all experienced, this is not true. Then, if we recognize the dangers of categorical thinking through past experiences, can we think outside of the frame and apply it to design practice? I conduct this research in the hope that my personal experience and story of history will be used as a tool for reflection and reconstruction by readers who are contemplating this direction together. So, first, I explain what kind of the dangers of categorical thinking it is, and give examples of how various visual materials which influence my perception and design decision come to me with dangers of categorical thinking. And I explain the dangers through 'Korean collectivist culture' which had been the greatest influence on my categorical thinking. In order to introduce 'Korean collectivism' which intensifies the social conflict due to the characteristics of selfish collectivism that pursues individual interests, the research, ‘The Influence of Korean Collectivism(Uri, we-ness) on Interpersonal Communication Behaviors’ by Jungeun Yan, 2019 was used as the main source. And I use the example of Samsung's advertisements and uniform culture to show how Korean society forced it to create one form through collectivism. Finally, I try to figure out the possibility by looking at examples of how de-categorization was attempted in various visual materials to think and reflect about the direction to reduce the dangers of categorical thinking. Reflecting on my personal history of individuals pressed into the category of a group, that is, the background of Korean collectivism, I finish this research by thinking about design directions that allow us to swim freely in and out of the categorization.

          <div id="Introduction" class="is-lightblue">
          <br>
          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Do I belong to the minority or the majority? For a long time, I didn't have any chance to think about putting myself in a specific group. That's why I didn't know how to put the name of the discomfort I felt, when someone group and define me into a group, or exclude me from a group. Until I know that this is called ‘discrimination’. These names of Korean, female, and young that refer to me are categorizations of identities that define me. The perceptions that are stuck in these categorizations are easily shifted to a way of discrimination. Anyone, small or large, may have experienced discrimination due to this categorical thinking. So I have tried not to have the dangers of simple categorical thinking because it make me and others uncomfortable. Nonetheless, we cannot be free of categorical thinking because it emerges naturally even when we try not to be conscious of it. For instance, personality type classification test, such as the MBTI, which is popular in Korea, is used for fun and to gain a better understanding of others, but it classifies people into one fixed type. It instructs people to consider a person's personality only in terms of these fixed types of characteristics, eliminating the possibility of other personalities. This is the structure that blocks the attempts itself to see a diverse aspect of each one of us. So, within this instinctive loop of categorical thinking, how can we recognize diversity and see social phenomena outside the framework of typicality? As a designer who communicates using a tool called graphic design, a visual language, I believe the most important thing to focus on is this correct perception direction. If we fall into fixed categorical thinking, we will call into question our qualifications as designers who are accountable for our outcomes. How will designers who do not value diversity communicate with the public? That's why the right perception and attitude are important to make the correct design decisions. Then, how can we make the best design decision without falling into the swamp of dangers of categorical thinking?
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
            As the first journey of this research, I explain why we categorize everything and demonstrate the reason for the dangers of categorical thinking as a result of categorization using visual language examples. To understand the phenomenon of discrimination and conflict caused by categorical thinking that surrounds me, I explain the 'Korean collectivist culture' with its selfish nature of exploiting groups for the interests of individuals. This fight for interests appears to be the most serious cause of conflict, and here is an invisible action of power, mass media. Through the mass media that can have a great influence without being revealed, I look into how Samsung takes advantage using collectivist ethnicity to gain benefits through advertising examples. Following that, visual research was carried out to discover the socio-cultural phenomenon of uniformed individuality as a result of collectivism. Based on personal uniformity experiences such as princess clothes and school uniforms, it shows the characteristics of an individual that are easily broken in the 'uniform culture phenomenon.’ I analyze the value by using examples of projects that attempted to de-categorize in order to lower the risk of categorical thinking, reflect this in my research, conclude by deciding which design direction to pursue.

        <h1>The dangers of categorical thinking</h1>
        <h2>Things that we can get from categorical thinking</h2>
        <p>
          Why do we still categorize everything consciously or unconsciously even we perceive the danger of stereotypes by categorization? While we constantly get information in our lives, we strive to convert this information into our knowledge. According to the Harvard Business Review, the brain automatically simplifies structures to process a vast amount of data. This process is an essential human instinct to understand and remember the world.
          <sup id="fnref:1"> <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
          Therefore, we are constantly naming all objects and categorizing phenomena. And simplified information has an efficient aspect of saving time that we must use to understand a phenomenon. In particular, in order to survive in contemporary society where the boundaries for specialization in a specific field are blurred, we must randomly acquire information from various fields. Therefore this efficient simplification of information, categorization, is essential to making it easier to respond and adapt in a rapidly changing environment. So, people who are already tired of being overwhelmed by the vast and rapidly changing information are turning to increasingly simplified information and believing that this is the solution.

      <h2>The danger of compressed universal language</h2>
      <p>
        For these reasons, categorization is a natural part of human survival and evolution, but there are certainly dangers in it, such as black-and-white, binary thinking. It is because categorization simplifies information, it blocks the possibility of seeing different aspects of a person. Because of the potential to block these multidimensional aspects, there is a risk of stereotyping if we simply put them into a category of a certain type. The danger of such categorical thinking is that it 'compress' the members of the category and treats them as if they are more similar than they are.
        <sup id="fnref:2"> <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a> </sup>
        For instance, both introvert and extrovert dispositions may exist within me, but when a typology test defines me as an introvert, it is accepted as if the result is true. This simple compression thus formalizes and removes my diversity within the frame. Let's take a look at how the danger of this compression is revealed in the visual medium through the following example.
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
        Here we can connect this problem into ‘toilet sign’ which is a universal visual language. Most people can easily understand the toilet sign consisting of male and female symbols. The reason why this toilet sign is used in many cultures is because of using a universal formative language created using the universal perception that we all have in common. The toilet sign, which is a pictogram, has been created to be easily read by many public, so complex elements have become simpler, and this simplification can compress many meanings and create misunderstandings and prejudices under the name of universality. Therefore, pictograms have a problem of 'reductionism'. According to Shin Kim's 'Beware of the reductionism of pictograms’, reductionism refers to the attempt to explain various, individual, and specific phenomena that cannot be abbreviated as one by compressing, generalizing, and abstracting them into one principle.
        <sup id="fnref:3"> <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a> </sup> This is the same logic as the risk of typicality created by categorical thinking. Therefore, universal formative language such as a toilet sign requires other attempts to reduce the problem of reductionism caused by this stereotype of categorical typicality. First of all, in order to represent the function of a toilet, there is no need to reveal the distinction of sex. For a more correct design direction, a sign that can recall the functional form of a toilet, not a traditional gender sign, should be used. However, no matter how many people have similar perceptions, the way they think of toilet images may differ depending on cultural and social perceptions. Implicative and symbolic languages, such as pictograms, which must take all of these into account, are practically difficult to maintain a neutral form.

    <h2>The danger of grouping</h2>
    <p>
      Categorization also creates the danger of 'self-stereotyping' that recognizes ourselves as a collective categorization rather than a unique individual. According to a study by The Korean Psychological Association on self-stereotyping, in this categorization process, de-personalization occurs because people are perceived as an exemplar of a social group rather than an individual. Therefore, it is possible to commit an error of self-stereotyping that recognizes the characteristics expected by society, culture, or others as their characteristics for the group to which they belong. This can ignore one's potential and create limitations on one's own.
      <sup id="fnref:4"> <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a> </sup>
      Not only self-stereotyping but also society creates stereotypes by grouping people into specific groups. Through examples of depersonalization, I demonstrate how this danger of grouping can occur.

      The Korean government released a map of the number of women of childbearing age based on the population of women aged 20 to 44 in local governments nationwide on 29th December 2016 on its website. The map shows that the darker pink, the more women population who can give birth. The government created this map to make the public aware of the seriousness of low birth rates, but this reveals the old perspective of Korean society. This map reflected the perception of women as a tool for childbirth without seeing them as an individual. The reason why this old perception was reflected in this map shows in a fragment that giving birth to women has been a mandatory role in Korean society. Therefore, the perspective is revealed that women are entirely responsible for the low birth rate problem. Websites with only pictures of women and children clearly show the perspective that men are not related to childbirth. Eventually, the service received a lot of criticism and it was immediately stopped launching day. This type of idea should be considered carefully because it has the potential to create a stereotypical image of a group as a whole rather than respecting individuals.

      Despite the danger of grouping, in which individuals are generalized to be typical of groups, humans instinctively desire to belong to groups. This desire is basically based on a fear of alienation. Here, in the group to which I belong, that is, in-group, people feel more intimacy and solidarity, and therefore try to become more like the members of the group. However, because I have relatively little in common with the group to which I do not belong, that is, the out-group, people distance themselves from the out-group and discriminate because they believe their own group is superior to other groups. This exclusivity solidifies the ideology of the people in the group and makes them believe that they are unique. Thus, this grouping eventually creates conflict and deepens prejudice among groups. In particular, Korea is one of the countries with a strong desire to have a sense of belonging. This appears through various categories such as country, family, gender, and so on. Such group-oriented thinking naturally appears as various conflict structures between groups. As I said before, humans have a natural tendency toward collectivism, but Korea's obsessive collectivism has resulted in a more magical effect on my categorical thinking. Therefore, I would like to try to find out how the category of a group was formed in Korea, how it created the structure of conflict, and how it influenced people through the historical background.
    </p>

  <div id="Korea" class="is-darkgreen">

    <h1>Korea which became one</h1>
    <h2>Conflict, Collectivism, and Korea</h2>
    <p>
      In the flow of histories such as the Later Three Kingdoms, Goryeo, and Joseon, Korea has maintained its bond as a single-race nation ​for a long time, therefore, the tendency of collectivism is strong. So this historical background proves that it was considered a good attitude not only to value groups grouped into various connections such as school relations and regionalism to naturally live in such groups but also to live as a ‘family’ even in groups without connections such as companies. According to 'The study of The Influence of Korean Collectivism(Uri, we-ness) on Interpersonal Communication Behaviors’, in addition, just as Koreans enjoy using the word 'we' and use the expression 'we' even when it means 'me', the collectivist sentiment of Koreans is melted into everyday language. Therefore, Korean collectivism is characterized by terms such as familism, nepotism, nationalism, patriotism, paternalism, and mainstream.
      <sup id="fnref:5"> <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      This collectivist disposition has heightened the conflict more due to the historical background of division. After independence from the Japanese conquer, Korean land was divided into North Korea and South Korea by the Soviet Union and the United States along the 38th parallel. Korea remains one of the few divided countries so far. In The Study of Social Conflict Structure in Korea, it is said that after division, Korean society is still showing various and serious social conflicts and divisions between groups amid rapid economic growth and changes in social structure.

      However, another study of Social Conflicts in South Korea says that politicians, who have to control conflict, promote social cohesion, and act as mediators, have amplified the conflict phenomenon. Moreover, as social conflicts accumulate as authoritarianism gives way to a democratic political system, the solution method prioritizes emotional confrontation and collective interests over rational negotiations and interest harmony.
      <sup id="fnref:7"> <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      Here, we should take a closer look at Korea's unique concept of collectivism. According to the 'The study of The Influence of Korean Collectivism' again, in Western theory collectivism is a concept that groups are more important than individuals and has characteristics such as individual sacrifice for groups, the importance of harmony between group members, and preference to work as a group. However, Koreans actually tend to use groups to achieve individual goals rather than sacrifice them for group goals, and they seem to value forming and maintaining good relationships between themselves and group members rather than considering harmony among group members.
      <sup id="fnref:8"> <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a> </sup>
      This seems to be for the group, but ultimately for the benefit of the individual. The use of collectivism for individual gain and the power struggle between them eventually leads to social conflict. Then, how does the power that causes this conflict work?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="which_became" class="is-darkgreen">
    <br>
    <h2>Media, invisible political power</h2>
    <p>
      According to Robert A. Dahl, power works in two ways: when there is a conflict of interest between individuals or groups, by suppressing the other and achieving goals, and by intervening in decision-making to prevent conflicts from surfacing. On the other hand, Steven Lukes' the third dimension of power refers to the power to adjust the tastes and interests of the other party so that no conflict of interest occurs.
      <sup id="fnref:9"> <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a> </sup>
      Since the third dimension of power is not a direct intervention using power, mass media and education are at the center of it. Mass media, which has no form and has a big influence that is universally exposed to everyone, is easy to unconsciously form our perception. Above all, it is actively showing the use of visual language. Then, in Korean society, what way does the media use visual language and how does it reach our perception?
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      In Korea, there is a sentence that shows unity, which is “우리가 남이가?”. It means, “We are not strangers” or “we are a family”. This sentence implies the community spirit of Korean collectivism, so it has been reproduced in a similar context within communities, social networks, and all kinds of other media. The reason why the media continues to use this characterization of collectivism is that there remains a stereotype of a collectivist idea even now that individual value pursuit has improved.

      Professor Seung-woo Jeon analyzed in the forum that Samsung, the most powerful company in Korea, promoted its products with a focus on collectivism. From 1988 to 1997, Samsung showed off the slogan ‘world’s first-class’ to broaden the business outside of Korea. So they made as a role themselves as a member of the national team to stress out ‘for strong Korea’. Using the name of Korea, they did not only reminds us of the power of unity of a nation but also made them appear to have enhanced the quality of their technology. Professor Seung-woo Jeon said in a forum titled 'Asking Samsung Again’, "Samsung delivered a message that each citizen needs to try to be the world's first-class, and this is a way to patriotize the country and a shortcut to a happy developed country.”

    <p>
      Unlike the development method that jumped on government policy, since the 1990s, when the balance of social power changed around a newly-rising business tycoon, the expression method of advertising has changed in line with these changes. In the process of the change, there was the IMF(International Monetary Fund) happened in 1997, and this incident effectively showed the positive direction of collectivism. This is a historic incident in which about 3.51 million people across the country voluntarily collected 227 tons of gold in just two months to overcome the financial crisis. However after the IMF bailout, mass unemployment, intensifying competition, and the collapse of the middle class occurred, and in this era, the traditional family was dismantled. Here, Samsung tried to build a bond between companies and consumers by using a friendly medium which is clay animation to include messages of importance for the meaning of the family under the slogan "Another Family.” In the midst of a social phenomenon in which traditional family values collapsed, Samsung which has great power, and recognizes the power of advertising did not miss the opportunity and attempted to group people into the family category. This advertisement has received a great response from the public so the series is made over the past 10 years, and it has served as an opportunity to increase familiarity and favorability for Samsung.

      Therefore, companies benefit from touching the collectivist perception of unconsciously embedded people. Looking at the results of the tendency of collectivism, which is gradually layered due to the historical background and media influence in the minds of Koreans, I could find the results of this as a social phenomenon called a 'uniform culture’. As for the Korean culture, which had to find identity within the group, the phenomenon can be grasped with visual evidence of the following research.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="one" class="is-darkgreen">
    <br>
    <h2>Uniform culture which bound us</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="pic"> <img style="mix-blend-mode:multiply;" src="img/pic_08.jpeg" alt=""> </div>
    <p>
      The visual research was initiated through a social phenomenal analysis of how stereotypical images, the result of categorical thinking, made people uniform. In addition, I also had the research question of how can we see collectivism in Korea visually? While collecting images about stereotypes, I found uniforms have been used a lot in Korean society. Since Korea, which has a dominant collectivist tendency, prefers a unified form of appearance, these uniforms are used in various fields of work. Usually, uniforms are used to emphasize expertise, create group unity, and give people a sense of belonging. But on the other hand, it can suppress someone’s individuality. Despite there is risk of losing individuality, some social groups in Korea, still prefer uniform culture because they are afraid of degradation of the identity of the group. Especially school uniform which is mandatory in many schools shows a way of how Korean society educates people in standardization using its. School uniforms, which have been used continuously since modernization, have had a period of time of deregulation. However, the system that believed it was right to be within the ideal image frame of being a student reinstated the school uniform system again. Therefore, students haven't had a chance to consider alternatives to uniforms since then.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      While collecting traces of uniforms from my childhood in the photo album, I found that not only uniforms but also stereotypical clothes for girls such as typical princess dresses were uniforms that standardize my taste. Even though there were more options in a freer environment after the school uniform period, we tried to unify with other people's tastes, such as buying trendy clothes. Wouldn't standardized clothes that fit our typical image affect our perception of the future and make it difficult to find individual tastes? Would we have changed if culture and education that respect individuality had been conducted since childhood? Will it be possible to deviate from the cycle of categorization in the inseparable collectivism to find individuality?
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      Through the results and questions of the visual research, it was concluded that the uniform image through categorization leads to a link of categorical dangers again. So, how do I think of the right design direction in the midst of the swamp of categorical thinking, its dangers, strong collectivism that causes conflict, and uniformity? Can I get closer to the answer if I look into projects that are wary of categorical thinking and have an open mind about diversity?

    </div>
    <p>
      In the first chapter, I referred that universal formative languages such as toilet signs have a problem of reductionism due to stereotypes about categorical typicality. And this universal formative language is not easy to contain all other cultural aspects simply but comprehensively. So here, the project The Annex of Universal Languages, by Edgar Walthert who began with a longing for a perfect and universal language, is a meaningful study attempted without fear of challenge. He collected historical examples of design for symbol-based universal languages. And he made a diagram that shows similar symbols from each of the visual languages, however, none of the visual language systems doesn't have a common universality. This is because these symbols are read differently depending on perception or cultural background. Therefore, it is not easy to escape from the typical image we already have. However, by revealing this utopia ideal about the universal language I think he could be more open to a diversity of language systems.

      <h3> Nike Korea <i>Women’s Just Do It</i> campaign advertisement in 2019 </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      People tired of one unity and one fixed image are moving to give value to themselves. They think it's no longer strange to do something alone and try to find the center in themselves. In 2019, Nike launched 'Women’s Just Do It' campaign advertisement world-widely, and Nike Korea used a storyline similar to original advertisements but applied social problems and culture at the time in Korea. In the commercial, they send a message: "believe in the greatness of yourself." to encourage women's independent life in their life. All women working in various fields appear as main characters, they actively show their own individuality beyond the frame of traditional gender roles. Due to the scene with the message that "my body belongs to me", it brings a misogyny crime case that was a big social issue in Korea. Women who have been thoroughly otherized and objectified in a patriarchal society, now tell someone beyond the camera that this story is all about us. Since the contents related to women's rights almost have never been dealt with in pop culture in Korea, the impact of the commercial was huge, and the favorability of the company has highly increased. Considering the structure of the advertising industry that needs to capture people in a very short time, there is a possibility that this will end up as a one-off event. However, showing a variety of people who deviate from the fixed image in the media eventually affects the random public, so I think the way they show it is a necessary step, whether small, large, or PC(politically correct).

      <h3> The project <i>MULTIFORM</i> developed by Studio Fontana. </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The next example to show an attempt to cross the boundaries of the normative aspect is the project MULTIFORM developed by Studio Fontana. The project MULTIFORM is an ongoing design research that questions and re-invents the social and political role of sport in contemporary society. Consisting of new uniforms, sports games, and objects, these whole kits play the role to provide innovation for discussion about diversity within education. The game consists of a total of three teams. Each team needs to defend the goal from other teams and attack other teams. However, when the referee blows the whistle during the game to the teams, they need to transform their clothes according to the signal. So teammates keep changing according to color or form of clothes. Because of the uniform that keeps transforming, ​the distinction between teams becomes meaningless and the boundaries disappear. Beyond just deconstructing the artefact of the uniform itself, MULTIFORM aims to radically question the normative aspect of design that constantly shapes our daily social interaction and perception.
      <sup id="fnref:11"> <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a> </sup>
      The designer used more performative design research here considering his own body as a research tool. And he tried to analyze people's behavior in social norms through body research.

      Complete de-categorization remains a utopian dream, but challengers' efforts to mix diversity in a society where stereotypes abound have resulted in several progressive questions and answers. I think the most active de-categorization is to recover the individuality fixed and simplified by categorization in collectivism. If we make design decisions in an attitude of respecting and accepting various aspects of an individual beyond the typicality of a group, wouldn't we be able to care about problems such as simplification, prejudice, stereotypes, discrimination, conflict, and uniformity? And if we minimize these problems, wouldn't we be able to choose the best design direction when returning ideas to visual language? However, if we reflect on our inherently categorical thinking, particularly my ego, which has a strong collectivist tendency, it is still difficult for us to completely escape the danger of categorical thinking. Although the research was conducted with the hope of de-categorization, categorization must have been made during this research. That's why we have to constantly practice thinking that flexibly moves in and out of this categorization.

    <p style="padding-left:3em;font-style: italic;" >
      Foucault understood art, modern art in particular, as an anticultural force, one that harbored the capacity to oppose unwarranted consensus, question our habits, and posit new values. If the role of politics is to find answers, the role of art is to ask questions.
      <sup id="fnref:13"> <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a> </sup>

      As Foucault said, significance is born from continuing to ask questions about the phenomena surrounding us. Questions about me as a stranger, thoughts about belonging, generalization of identity, and categorical thinking that discriminates against it were the starting points of the journey to find significance. The essential process for surviving which is categorization leads to the dangers of simplified, typified, grouping, stereotyping, etc. People instinctively group because everyone wants a sense of belonging, but Korea's sticky collectivism creates conflict, which is the other side of a sense of belonging. The secret act of power which is mass media uses the idea of collectivism to benefit from the back of the conflict. And rigid Korean collectivism which is eager to be one does not allow individuality. Therefore, the uniform culture reflects the elimination of individuality resulting from the dangers of categorization. Despite this negative phenomenon of categorization and group uniformity, attempts to the restoration of individuality, such as the universal language, belief in one's own greatness, and multi-form, show the direction and attitude we should pursue as designers, or communicators. Complete de-categorization is a utopian story, but the way it is realized is not utopian.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:3em;" >
      In a way, I who have a collectivist background think it is a natural result that I felt uncomfortable and had primitive questions about categorization in this social system that values the unity of the group. But this is not just the case from my side, it can be to all. For example, we are all unconsciously exposed to the media and influenced by political ideals with different positions. We continue to think categorically, and in many moments that we don't recognize, we fall into a swamp of stereotypes. They dazzle and re-fix our minds back with familiar forms, colors, and roles. However, in this delusion of typicality, we hope to enlighten borderless utopia and dream of the right categorization. Categorical thinking, the main culprit of stereotypes, is indispensable, so it is inevitable to accept it, so it should be able to freely cross the gaps between different categories. Understanding sounds like an ideal dream that can never come true because each person has lived in a different way. Therefore, the dangers of categorical thinking are inevitable, but wouldn't we be able to continue to discover possibilities for the best design decision if we recognize the dangers and swim flexibly between categorizations? And if we could swim in that space composed of categorical thinking, wouldn't we be able to keep asking questions about de-categorization even if we couldn't find a clear answer about it? Since categorical thinking is one of the undeniable sources of communication, isn't flexibility the best way to use categorical thinking as an appropriate source of communication? The creation eventually consists of the artist's perception, and the outcome provides a place for mutual exchange of perceptions that each other has. I hope everyone will be actively swimming in categorization, and use the categorization zone as a place for mutual exchange of perceptions. Finally, reflecting on this research, I expect to have a clear perception to find the right direction in my design discipline in this uniform categorical thinking.
